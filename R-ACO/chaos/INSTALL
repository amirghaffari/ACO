The simplest way is

make

or

./rebar compile

It also works cleanly if you include it as a dependency in rebar.

To test, find yourself a project, include the path to the code, run
application:start(pman), application:start(chaos_monkey), and then run
chaos_monkey:on() or chaos_monkey:kill(), to kill processes over time
or kill a single process respectively.  You can also test the
stability of a single application with
chaos_monkey:almost_kill([AppName]).

I've personally been using cowboy_examples for testing.  Just because
installation was so extremely quick.  If your current working
directory is chaos_monkey, then do:

cd ..
git clone https://github.com/extend/cowboy_examples.git
make

Add "-pa ../chaos_monkey/ebin -s chaos_monkey \" as the third line in
start.sh (see below for diff).

You can now run The Chaos Monkey according to the documentation in
README.  Note that cowboy_examples have temporary applications so over
time you will kill it off and The Chaos Monkey will have nothing to
do.

Happy killing.
