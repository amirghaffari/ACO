This directory contains various SMTWTP instances.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The directory 'orlib' contains data downloaded from
http://people.brunel.ac.uk/~mastjjb/jeb/orlib/wtinfo.html

Instances of size 40, 50, and 100 (together with optimal solutions)
are provided.  These were used in many early papers on SMTWTP.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The directory 'geiger' contains data downloaded from
http://logistik.hsu-hh.de/SMTWTP.

This is the data described in "New Instances for the Single Machine
Total Weighted Tardiness Problem" by Martin Geiger.  There are
instances of size 1000, and hard instances of size 100.  Note 
that optimal solutions are also given.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The directory 'various' contains single instances of sizes between 50 and 1000,
generated by the 'mkinst' program.  These are usful for checking how solution
time scales with problem size.
